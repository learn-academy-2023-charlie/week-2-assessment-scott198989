# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameters are used in the function and arguements are used when the function is called to give value to the parameter.

Researched answer: The difference is parameters are names listed in the function while arguements are real values.  

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: the predefined parameters are a call back function that states what action is to be peformed, the parameters are value, index, and array.  index and array are optional while it is requred to have value.  

Researched answer:
The parameters that affect the function are value, index and array. `this` can be used to reference an object which would be passed through the .map arguement

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map will iterate of the entire array and do something to each value and return an array of the same length.  .filter will return a subset of the array based on conditional logic i.e. returning only even or odd numbers ect...

Researched answer:
.map returns a new array where you have applied some action so that it changes the original element. filter returns subset array of the elements of the original array (with no change to the original values)

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: To go through an array and perform a action on each condition such as every string, every index, only at the 4th index ect...

Researched answer: Used when we want to execute code over an array or object once and change the elements or properties of the values.  Used in for loops.

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: a function is a block of code that can be used and re used several times over to perform a certain action where a method performs a action similar to a function but in an object or class.  

Researched answer: A function is a stand alone block of code that can be used multiple times.  A method is a function called on in a specific occurance in a object or class where it lives.  

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Honestly I am not sure.  Best guess says it has something to do with lifting or raising... pushing maybe?  As in pushing values into other blocks of code?  Research is needed.  

Researched answer: I wasnt too far off.  From what I gather hoisting is moving declared variables to the top of their scope, which we have been unknowning doing when we run our jest tests.  

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Often used in React as a self contained block of code that defines a specific part of the UI.  Components are building blocks of the website and can have HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

2. Spread operator: used by typing ... and expands iterated objects like arrays, strings and objects into individual elements

3. React state: represents the current state of an object in React and stores data that can change with the component

4. React props: properties in React used to pass data from one component to another

5. DOM events: actions that happen because of user interaction like clicking on a button, hovering over an element or scrolling through a webpage.
